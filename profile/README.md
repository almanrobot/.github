**Alman Robot** is a language learning project designed to help **Turkish citizens** practice speaking German and prepare for the **TELC language exam**.

## v1 – Membership Model (2023)

In 2023, Alman Robot was launched with a **subscription (membership) model**.

In this version:
- Users could practice German and prepare for exams using **pre-created content**.
- Users also had the option to create their **own custom content** for personalized practice.
- To support high traffic expectations, a **scalable and cloud-native architecture** was built.

## v2 – Pivot & Advertising Model (2024)

Towards the end of 2024, when Alman Robot failed to reach its targeted user growth and revenue goals, a **pivot decision** was made.

During this phase:
- The company was shut down.
- The membership model was discontinued.
- The project was repositioned to continue with an **advertising-based revenue model**.

## Project Termination (2026)

In 2026, the Alman Robot project was fully **sunset**, and all development activities were discontinued.
